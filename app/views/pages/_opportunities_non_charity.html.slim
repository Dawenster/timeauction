        | These are examples of work that may not be directly related to a registered charity or not-for-profit, but that Time Auction may still accept on a case-by-case basis. We will still need to verify your hours, so please take pictures if appropriate and make sure someone else is involved so that we are convinced you have done charitable work.

    = "If you have an initiative that is charitable in nature, then please reach out to us at #{link_to 'team@timeauction.org', 'mailto:team@timeauction.org'} to discuss if it will count as Time Auction hours. By charitable, we mean that the goal of the initiative is not to make money, but to help others.".html_safe
