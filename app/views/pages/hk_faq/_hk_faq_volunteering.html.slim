    | Time Auction counts volunteer hours at government-registered charities and not-for-profits.  We evaluate any requests for volunteering at social enterprises, self-started initiatives, or other charitable causes on an individual basis.  Please reach out to us to confirm if what you plan to do will be allowed.
