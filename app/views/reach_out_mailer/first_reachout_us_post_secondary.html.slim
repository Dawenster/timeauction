By asking prominent alumni to be Time Auctions, universities are able to use Time Auction as a tool to build new relationships with potential major donors. The University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada had a 70% success rate when it asked its prominent alumni to be Time Auctions. It's a soft ask to start engaging those who may not otherwise be engaged.".html_safe

It would be a different way to build relationships with potential major donors while engaging #{@short_name} students who volunteer. I'd love to set up a 15-min call to chat further if you'd like to learn more?".html_safe
